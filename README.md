# AutomaticVideoEditor
A simple music video editor made using moviepy

The purpose of this project was to reduce the time spent editing JPEGs with music.  
It can be quite the hassle to sync photos to the beat of a song.
This editor determines the BPM of a song and uses that to edit the images that it is given.
