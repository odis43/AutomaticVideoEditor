# AutomaticVideoEditor
A simple music video editor made using moviepy

The purpose of this project was to reduce the time spent editing a video with music.
It can be quite the hassle to sync photos to the beat of a song so, this editor determines the BPM of a song and uses that to edit the images that it is given.

BE SURE TO HAVE ALL PHOTOS BE .JPEG AND INSIDE THE DIRECTORY THE SCRIPT IS IN
